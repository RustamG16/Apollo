Implement the approved Apollo Oracle-first prototype in `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\apollo-studio`.

Read these sources in order:

1. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\START-HERE.md`
2. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\AGENTS.md`
3. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\New_upgradePlan\PRODUCT-ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\New_upgradePlan\CONTINUOUS-UI-CONTRACT.md`
6. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\New_upgradePlan\media\apollo-continuous-journey-v2\ROUTING.md`
7. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\New_upgradePlan\IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
8. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\New_upgradePlan\MASTERPLAN.md`
9. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\New_upgradePlan\SAVRA-VERIFICATION.md`
10. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\apollo-studio\ARCHITECTURE-ESSENTIALS.md`
11. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\apollo-studio\PRODUCT.md`
12. `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\apollo-studio\DESIGN.md`

This is an explicitly authorized implementation request. The product direction is approved; do not restart intake or generate alternative concepts. Use the Olympus abridged trail and record Gates A and B as `approved-in-plan`. Gate C remains a real user review.

The approved direction is:

- The canonical journey is `Home → Oracle intake → Design DNA and brief → Master Plan → Configure → Playground test → Approve → Execute → Results and QA → Continue`.
- Use the numbered images in `New_upgradePlan\media\apollo-continuous-journey-v2\` as the canonical screen sequence. Older isolated mockups are superseded where they conflict.
- Every screen must share the exact shell defined by `CONTINUOUS-UI-CONTRACT.md`: one 210px dark rail, one route order, one route/status strip, one semantic color meaning, and one fixed bottom-center Oracle dock.
- Knowledge and System may contain dark technical canvases inside the common paper workspace; they may not introduce a different shell or theme.

- Manus is the category archetype for task-first agent work, not the visual style to copy.
- Oracle is the only front door. It proactively asks relevant unanswered questions using conversation, voice, files and selectable choices.
- Oracle produces a reviewable brief and Design DNA; the Design Director creates the master plan and six-file project context.
- The user can inspect and adjust agent tasks, skills, MCPs/plugins, models, constraints, permissions and fallbacks before execution.
- Playground isolates Setup A/B experiments and explains which capabilities change and how; tests never mutate production implicitly.
- Implementation is the final gated stage, after plan/design approval and explicit model/environment selection.
- Results provides artifacts, versions, evidence, QA, independent review and approval state.
- Knowledge is searchable first and graphical second.
- System Node Control is the advanced cinematic graph view; ordinary work never requires graph literacy.
- A bottom-center contextual Oracle composer persists across primary views and visibly lists its removable context sources.
- The first implementation is a local, low-cost prototype using real Apollo artifacts and explicit deterministic fixtures. Do not claim cloud autonomy.

Preserve the exact Olympus operating logic that produced the stronger Savra run: one director, bounded specialists, one direction, design tokens before layout, build from the plan, author QA, independent critic, maximum two repair cycles. Use the existing six runtime roles. Specialists may not delegate; author and critic are sequential.

Before editing production code:

1. Inspect git status and preserve unrelated changes.
2. Inspect current Studio source, APIs, tests and `.olympus` artifacts.
3. Write/update `.olympus/00-brief.md`, `.olympus/06-build-plan.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `design.json` and `.olympus/run.json` as required by Olympus.
4. Make `06-build-plan.md` the complete creative design document: exact tokens, type scale, page grammar, per-screen data/media map, interaction states, motion choreography, mobile transformation and acceptance criteria. No `TBD` values.
5. Validate the six project context files.

Then execute `New_upgradePlan/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` in order with test-first, independently reviewable slices. Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` if available; otherwise use `superpowers:executing-plans`. Do not ask the user to choose execution style again.

Do not modify Apollo's reusable agent, skill, registry, template or doctrine sources to make the UI pass. Do not install CrewAI, migrate to React, add WebGL, add cloud billing, or build a marketplace. Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.

Use the supplied reference media under `D:\Analyst_Designer\Apollo\New_upgradePlan\media` as evidence, but treat `media\apollo-continuous-journey-v2\` as authoritative for routing, hierarchy, shell, and screen relationships. Extract technical grid, precise luminous paths, condensed operational typography, high-contrast status and purposeful system motion. Do not copy Instagram/browser chrome or another product's distinctive expression. Keep Home, Projects and Results comprehensible; reserve the full network spectacle for System Node Control.

Implement the whole navigable trip, not a gallery of disconnected routes. A user must be able to start on Home, complete Oracle intake, approve the Brief, inspect and approve the Plan, test a configuration in Playground, return the tested setup to Plan, select the implementation model/environment, follow execution, inspect Results/QA, and reach Gate C using visible controls. Every step must provide a back path, cancellation semantics, current location, and next required action.

Continue through implementation and both verification passes. Stop only for a material rights, scope, cost, permission or technical-risk decision that cannot be resolved from the approved documents. At completion, present Gate C evidence: changed files, desktop/mobile screenshots, tests and browser checks, known limitations, provenance, finish verdict and residual tradeoffs.

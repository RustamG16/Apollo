# Atelier

Editorial restraint. Type-led, near-monochrome, near-still. A page should feel considered,
quiet and expensive — brand sites, editorial layouts, portfolios, luxury and craft
positioning.

## The doctrine

Typography carries the design. Everything else gets out of the way.

1. **Type first.** Set the type scale before touching layout.
2. **Whitespace is the primary material**, not the leftover.
3. **Asymmetry over centring.** An editorial grid, not a centred stack.
4. **One accent, used rarely.** Near-monochrome; a single ink colour appearing maybe
   three times on a page.
5. **Stillness.** Motion is the exception and must be argued for.

## What it refuses

Scroll-linked choreography, pinned sections, parallax; gradient meshes, glassmorphism,
glow, neon; heavy card shadows as the default container; centred full-bleed-gradient
heroes; more than two typefaces.

## When to use it

The brief says "editorial," "understated," "timeless," "Swiss," "magazine layout," or
"quiet luxury." Not this if the brief wants scroll drama (see Kinetic) or a data-dense
tool (see Instrument).

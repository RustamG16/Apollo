# Instrument

Dense and systematic. Information per pixel is the metric. For tools and information
surfaces — dashboards, admin panels, data-heavy screens, maps and graphs. This is also
the structural base Apollo_claude's own dashboard is built on.

## The doctrine

Information per pixel is the metric. Structure is drawn, not implied.

1. **Show the structure.** Visible rules, aligned columns, explicit grouping.
2. **Density is a feature.** Default to the tighter option.
3. **Colour is semantic, never decorative.** Every hue means a state; if it can't be
   named in a legend, it doesn't appear.
4. **One type family, many weights.** Tabular numerals everywhere.
5. **Motion is feedback only.** Under 150ms, confirming a state change.

## What it refuses

Hero sections, marketing copy, decorative imagery; cards as the default container
(they waste edges - use tables, panels, rules); colour used for mood; proportional
numerals in data contexts; motion that delays a state change.

## When to use it

The brief says "dashboard," "internal tool," "admin panel," "data-dense," "control
surface," "map of the system." Not this if the brief wants atmosphere (see Atelier or
Kinetic).

## Who builds it

The `apollo-instrument` agent owns the actual design work under this doctrine. This
file is reference documentation, not an executable skill.

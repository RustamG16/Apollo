# jakubkrehel/skills

Eleven skills, none installed. The most actively maintained repo in the set — pushed
2026-08-27, one day before verification.

## The eleven

| Skill | Job |
|---|---|
| `better-accessibility` | a11y pass over an interface |
| `better-colors` | colour system correction |
| `better-interface` | general interface improvement |
| `better-layout` | layout and composition |
| `better-typography` | type scale, measure, hierarchy |
| `better-ui` | broad UI polish |
| `better-writing` | UX copy |
| `break` | deliberate disruption of a stale design (name only — contents unread) |
| `explain-interface` | articulates what an interface is doing and why |
| `interface-review` | structured critique |
| `variant` | generate alternative treatments of the same component |

## Why it matters here

The `better-*` family is a **single-axis improvement** pattern: each skill changes one
dimension of an interface and leaves the rest alone. That is materially different from
the broad "make this look better" skills already installed — `impeccable`,
`web-design-pro`, `frontend-design` — which change everything at once and therefore can
never be applied surgically.

`variant` is the other notable one. Generating several treatments of one component is
exactly the primitive needed for the multi-setup design approach in
[../07-design-systems/](../07-design-systems/).

## Overlap with installed

`better-accessibility` overlaps `design:accessibility-review`; `interface-review`
overlaps `design:design-critique` and the `themis` agent. `better-colors`,
`better-typography`, `better-layout`, `variant` and `break` have no local equivalent.
